  1) Support for Search (and replace)

  DONE: 2) Region selection highlighting

  3) Better c-mode sytax highlighting

  4) User configuration settings and user/project/directory config files

  5) Mult-buffer and Split-screen modes

  6) Bug fixes: do we need a tracker (and where?)
     DONE: - Cursor refresh glitching
     DONE: - Curses coloring (and random text highlighting with sustained use)
     - PyE crashes if passed a non-existent file as a command-line arg
     DONE: - PyE doesn't shut down correctly, causing a segfault every time
     - Background coloring is broken (ncurses stuff)

  7) Documentation: Mostly for the pye extenstion API

  8) Auto-complete

  9) Extension hot-reloading

  10) Python exception handling on the C side

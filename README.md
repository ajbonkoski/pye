PyE, A Modern Terminal Text-Editor
---
PyE is a modern terminal-based text-editor. PyE can be viewed as a re-imagining of the classic, yet aging editors Emacs and Vim.  It aims to provide a modern editing experience, while providing emacs-style full configurability using Python. This enables the use of Python's enormous set of libraries. Also, the use of a modern and mainstream language allows PyE extensions to be contributed back to the larger Python community, something that Lisp, Emacs, and Vim traditionally struggle with.
